# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipes website that I am working on to test my HTML knowledge as I'm learning web development through The Odin Project. 
In this particular project I'll be using basic HTML and some CSS that I already know before starting The Odin Project.
The things I learned from The Odin Project (And will be the things I focus on) are:

    1- Text
    2- Lists
    3- Images
    4- Nesting elements
    5- Using the command line exclusively 
    6- File organization based on the type of the file and hierarchy
